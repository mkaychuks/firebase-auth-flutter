# auth_tutorial

A new Flutter project where I explored Google's BaaS (firebase authentication).

## Things I was able to achieve are..
1. Sign-in using GoogleSignIn.
2. Create/Register users (createUserWithEmailAndPassword() from firebase ).
3. Log users in (signInWithEmailAndPassword() from firebase ).
4. Send and verify email address of a user that creates an account.
5. Learned how to use GoRouter to handle navigation.
6. Managed State using Provider.
7. Implemented SharePrefences.


### packages from `pub.dev` that I used
- firebase_auth: provides the auth functions from firebase to flutter.
- firebase_core: firebase core packages.
- flutter_screenutil: allows for adaptability across different screen sizes.
- go_router: used for navigation across screens.
- google_fonts: fonts packages for google supported fonts.
- google_sign_in: allows flutter to access google sign-in
- provider: for state management.
- shared_preferences: storing users preferences locally.
